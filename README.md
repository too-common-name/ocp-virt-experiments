# OpenShift Virtualization Experiments

This repository contains a series of hands-on experiments to explore the features and integrations of **OpenShift Virtualization**.

## Included Experiments

* **[live-migration-ephemeral-vm](./live-migration-ephemeral-vm/):** An analysis of live migration for completely stateless (ephemeral) virtual machines, provisioned via `containerDisk`. The experiment uses a Fedora VM with NGINX as a reverse proxy for an application in a Pod.
* **[gitops](./gitops/):** Some GitOps experiments (check the folder README).

## ⚠️ Project Goal 

This project is not intended to define production-ready patterns but rather to serve as a "lab" to study several aspects of the technology.
